                  Where Bitcoin was hailed as the digital answer to currency,
                  NFTs are now being touted as the digital answer to
                  collectables, but plenty of sceptics fear they're a bubble
                  waiting to burst.

                  It could be a house, or a painting such as the Mona Lisa,
                  which is one of a kind. You can take a photo of the painting
                  or buy a print but there will only ever be one original
                  painting.

                  Former Christie's auctioneer Charles Allsopp said the concept
                  of buying NFTs made "no sense". "The idea of buying something
                  which isn't there is just strange," he told the BBC.

                  It might sound ridiculous but the explosive market of
                  crypto-collectibles and crypto-art is no joke. I investigate
                  cryptocurrencies and have academic publications on Bitcoin
                  markets. To help you understand what an NFT is and why they’re
                  becoming so popular, here’s an explainer to make sense of it
                  all.

                  The bidding on Musk’s tweet has already topped $1 million and
                  millions more are pouring into the market — he has since
                  tweeted, “Actually, doesn’t feel quite right selling this.
                  Will pass.” And sites like NBA Top Shot (where you can buy,
                  sell and trade digital NBA cards) have individual cards
                  selling for over US$200,000.

                  A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file with verified
                  identity and ownership. This verification is done using
                  blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, simply put, is
                  an un-hackable system based on the mathematics of
                  cryptography. So, that’s why you hear a lot of “crypto” when
                  referring to NFTs — crypto-art, crypto-collectibles, etc.

                  Poised to radically reconfigure the crypto-asset market,
                  non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are revolutionizing our
                  conception of money and value, creating not just entirely new
                  markets but even new economies that are able to scale globally
                  and to discover value in undreamt places, relegating to
                  oblivion fiat currencies and old ways of doing business.

                  Just kidding. The previous paragraph is a parody (if such is
                  possible) of the hype that in the first half of has come to
                  surround non-fungible tokens. Indeed, the hype has become so
                  overpowering that it may even defy parody. Non-fungible tokens
                  can have legitimacy, and I’ll discuss how that can be at the
                  end of this article. But for now the overwhelming majority of
                  what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled by the hope of a
                  quick return and the belief that something can be gotten for
                  nothing (or virtually nothing).

                  But digital collectibles, whatever else they may be,
                  are—without exception or remainder—digital files. In other
                  words, they’re just strings of bits. As a string of bits, a
                  digital file has a fixed number of bits, with the bit at any
                  location in the string having a definite value of either zero
                  or one.{" "}

                  Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be interchanged with
                  other individual assets of the same kind; it implies equal
                  value between the assets. If you own a fungible asset you can
                  readily interchange it for another of a similar kind. Fungible
                  assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, and the best
                  example would be (you guessed it) money.

                  This is where I can explain and emphasize the
                  “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main difference
                  between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact that Bitcoins are
                  limited, and fungible (you can trade one Bitcoin with another
                  and both have the same value and price). NFTs are unique but
                  unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are the same).
                  While NFTs can appreciate in value (just like real estate),
                  they cannot be interchanged for another NFT.
