# Peace Peace

## Introduction
Peace Peace is blockchain-based event ticketing system designed for "peaceful ticketing". By leveraging the transparency, security, and immutability of blockchain technology, tickets are issued as unique digital assets that are traceable and securely transferred between users. The system ensures that only legitimate transactions occur, preventing bulk purchasing by bots or unauthorized resale at inflated prices. Additionally, smart contracts manage ticket distribution, ownership transfers, and enforce resale policies, promoting fair pricing and accessibility for genuine attendees.
