## About Data Force
    Data Force is a decentralized data marketplace application, running on a EVM blockchain network. This application provides users with a means to store data truly private, with no central access given to anyone, even the application owners. Users can also choose to monetize their data, by selling it for a fixed price, or a subscription model for growing data. It can also be used as a secure private cloud. Made a secure server which takes in a ML models and trains it with decentralized data from IPFS without revealing the actual dataset content and returns a trained model with its analysis.
